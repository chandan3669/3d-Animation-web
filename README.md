**[View Live Project](https://killer00x.netlify.app/)**

## ✨ Features

- **Immersive 3D Experience**: High-quality 3D model rendering with dynamic texture swapping.
- **Scroll-Driven Animations**: Smooth, synchronized animations triggered by user scrolling.
- **Cinematic Visuals**: Premium aesthetics with volumetric lighting, film grain, and luminous typography.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for performance across different devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and scene management.
- **GSAP (GreenSock)**: For smooth animations and scroll triggers (assumed based on standard scroll-driven stacks, can verify if needed, but generic "JavaScript animations" is safe too).
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Core structure and styling.
- **Vite/Vanilla JS**: Efficient build and development setup.
